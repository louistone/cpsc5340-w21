Furthermore, one of the important issues with machine learning and time series analytics is the existence of noise in datasets. Machine learning algorithms are sensitive to noise and hence, denosing is a crucial step to perform before using any machine learning algorithm. Current research problems that I am working on them are as follows:\n\nReal time techniques for time series denoising using information theory and deep learning\nAnomaly detection in cyber-physical systems in order to perform fault detection and fault location with the aim of reliability improvement\nUsing open source datasets for forecasting applications in health science and tourism industry\nWikipedia usage behavior modeling\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "joined": 1999, "handle": "khadivi-pejman"}
