In smart grids, we have been working on designing techniques for integrating renewable energy in building consumption to cut their electricity bills, grid consumption, demand peaks, and make their consumption profile more grid-friendly and sustainable. In the area of large-scale networks, we have devised novel traffic engineering algorithms to improve resource utilization in Internet backbone networks.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0", "joined": 2000, "handle": "mishra-aditya"}
